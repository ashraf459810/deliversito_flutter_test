### Tests
 I have included two types of tests in this project:

 Integration Tests:
this test demonstrate the user flow, allowing you to choose options from the breeds dropdown and sub-breeds dropdown before clicking the submit button.
You can run these tests in the terminal using the following command:    

    flutter test integration_test

Unit Tests:
Specifically for the fetching breeds use case, you can run all unit tests in the terminal using:

    flutter test


### Architecture
I used the Clean Code Architecture, which consists of three layers to enhance code maintainability and scalability.

### UI/UX

I have implemented a simple and responsive design. This design was achieved using the flutter_screen_utils package, ensuring a consistent and pleasing user experience across various devices.
